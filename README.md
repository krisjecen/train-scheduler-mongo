# train-scheduler
(this app is in under construction!)

With the help of mongoDB, this Train Scheduler displays train arrival data and allows for additional train data entries from users.

You can view the current train destinations, frequencies, and see when the next trains will arrive, including how many minutes you have for grabbing a drink before you catch your train.

Add a train by filling in the form at the bottom of the page and clicking the "Add Train" button. Share the Train Scheduler with your friends and they'll be able to see how much train data knowledge you have.

Future features, coming soon: edit & remove train schedule entries so the schedule stays neat and up to date!

This site uses mongoDB, JavaScript, and MomentJS.
